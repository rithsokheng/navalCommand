/**
 * Encapsulates turn management, weapon selection and the firing pipeline.
 * Extracted from GameController so the controller can stay a thin mediator (SRP).
 *
 * <p>Two architectural fixes:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The AI branch {@code if (aiStrategy != null && attacker == player2)} is gone:
 *       whoever holds the turn is asked for a {@link ShotOrder} through the
 *       polymorphic {@link Player#decideAutonomousShot()} (V2.2).</li>
 *   <li>Every shot updates the <em>shooter's</em> {@link TrackingGrid} — the only
 *       fog-of-war model in the game — instead of the shooter reading the
 *       defender's grid (V1.3 / Smell 5.2).</li>
